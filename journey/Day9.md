# Day 9

### Objectives
- Add lil instruction screen on first play
- Work on future stuff. Priority is:
    - Add arrows to ball to show direction ✅
    - Fix ball direction on release (align with arrow) ✅
    - Move bricks closer together
    - Refactor collision logic to use filter instead of find. THen we should be able to remove RIGHT_CORNER and LEFT_CORNER enums. If it's touching 2 sides (e.g. top and right), then we know it's a corner
    - Add event driven architecture
    - Move music to gcloud storage and download project
    - DEPLOY !!!!
