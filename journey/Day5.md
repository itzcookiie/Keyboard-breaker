# Day 5

### Objectives
- Add collision detection between ball and bricks ✅
- Add conditions to check when it is game over
- Fix collision between ball and wall. Ball goes over wall sometimes by a lil bit instead of rebounding at the edge of the circle ✅
- Fix collision between ball and side of board ✅


### What I actually done
- Spent most of the time working on collision logic between ball and bricks
