# Day 4

### Objectives
- Add collision detection between ball and bricks
- Add conditions to check when it is game over
- Fix collision between ball and wall. Ball goes over wall sometimes by a lil bit instead of rebounding at the edge of the circle ✅
- Fix collision betweenn ball and side of board ✅


### What I actually done
- Spent time at the end of the day (current 9.33pm) trying to make ball board collision cooler/more fun
- By making ball reflect at larger angles the further it is from the center
- Will try a bit more tomo. May just skip and add as future so we can focus on MVP
