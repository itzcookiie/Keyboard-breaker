- Make canvas border more glossy
- Create a Cord/Vector interface and use that when passing x, y data around
- Create an index.js file in entities, export all entities there, then import the file using * syntax and loop over each entitiy instead of adding manually
- Change logic between collision between ball/board, so the ball bounces at lower angles the further it is hit from the center of the board (e.g. at the board corners, it bounces at a very steep angle or towards the ground)
- When resizing window, update game canvas height/width so mouse pointer will always be in center of board when moving it
- Refactor collision logic. Use filter instead of find. You know it's hit a corner when you filter for collision cords and in the results, the side field = e.g. RIGHT and TOP
